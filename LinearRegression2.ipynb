    "R-squared measures the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable (Y) that is explained by the independent variables (predictors) in the model.\n",

    "Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate to use in the following situations:\n",
    "1.Multiple Predictors (Independent Variables): Adjusted R-squared is particularly valuable when you are working with regression models that include multiple predictor variables. In such cases, regular R-squared may increase when you add more predictors to the model, even if they do not contribute significantly to the model's explanatory power. Adjusted R-squared helps address this issue by considering the number of predictors in the model.\n",
    "2.Model Comparison: When you are comparing multiple regression models with varying numbers of predictors, adjusted R-squared can assist in model selection. It penalizes models with additional predictors that do not improve the model's fit substantially, helping you identify the best-fitting model.\n",
    "3.Complex Models: In situations where your regression model is complex, possibly due to a large number of predictors, using adjusted R-squared is essential. It helps you strike a balance between model fit and model complexity, allowing you to assess whether the addition of new predictors is justified.\n",
    "4.Avoiding Overfitting: Adjusted R-squared is a useful tool for preventing overfitting in regression models. It discourages the inclusion of unnecessary predictors that can lead to overfitting, which is a common issue when regular R-squared is used as the sole evaluation metric.\n",
    "5.Model Interpretability: In scenarios where model interpretability is important, adjusted R-squared encourages the selection of simpler models that are easier to interpret. This can be crucial in fields like economics and social sciences, where the interpretability of the model is essential for making meaningful conclusions.\n",
    "6.Small Sample Sizes: When working with small sample sizes, adjusted R-squared is preferable because it adjusts for the degrees of freedom in the model. It provides a more reliable measure of goodness of fit in cases where the sample size is limited."

Here are some of the limitations and scenarios where regularized linear models may not be the optimal choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Loss of Information: Regularization methods can be too aggressive in pushing coefficients toward zero, leading to a loss of information. If you have a small dataset or genuinely believe that all features are important, L1 regularization, in particular, might discard potentially useful information by setting some coefficients to zero.\n",
    "2.Linear Assumption: Linear models assume that the relationship between features and the target variable is linear. In many real-world scenarios, this assumption doesn't hold. If the true relationship is highly nonlinear, regularized linear models may not capture it well.\n",
    "3.Feature Engineering: Regularized linear models might not handle complex feature engineering or interactions between features effectively. Other models, like decision trees or ensemble methods, may be better suited for capturing complex interactions between features.\n",
    "4.Multicollinearity: While Ridge regression helps mitigate multicollinearity (high correlation between features), it doesn't provide feature selection. It shrinks coefficients but doesn't set any to zero. In situations where you need to identify and eliminate redundant features, methods like feature selection or dimensionality reduction might be more suitable.\n",
    "5.Interpretability: Regularized linear models, especially L1 regularized models, can reduce the model's interpretability because they set some coefficients to zero. In scenarios where interpretability is crucial, a simple linear model without regularization might be preferred.\n",

In such cases, it might be more efficient to use models that don't involve solving an optimization problem, like decision trees or some ensemble methods.\n",
